## [IBISBAHub](https://hub.ibisba.eu) is a key part of the IBISBA ecosystem of facilities  

### The IBISBAHub is the Place to Share Scientific Information Related to the IBISBA 1.0 Project. 

It serves as an online portal for:

- Recording  progression of projects using the IBISBA facilities
- Storing, sharing and launching workflows linked with related data and models
- Data registration using the ISA structure (Investigation, Study, Assay)
- Support for workflows operating in and across the facilities
- Catalogue of Workflows and Standard Operating  Protocols (SOPs)
- Library of data format templates and processes for the IBISBA consortium
- Complementing local data management OR provide a data management resource where local system is not available
- Support accessibility (from local/fully private to published projects)

### Project Structure on IBISBAHub (ISA Structure):

The projects are structured and stored on the IBISBAHub around the ISA framework:

- 'Investigation' (the research context/hypothesis)
- 'Study' (a unit of research)
- 'Assay' (analytical measurement/Experiments)

The ISA framework helps you to provide a complete description of your experimental metadata i.e. sample characteristics, technology used, measurement types, sample-to-data relationships. This results in your project being organised and the data you produce is easily reproducible and reusable.
